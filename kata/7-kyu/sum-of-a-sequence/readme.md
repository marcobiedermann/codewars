# [Sum of a sequence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/586f6741c66d18c22800010a)

Your task is to make function, which returns the sum of a sequence of integers.

The sequence is defined by 3 non-negative values: **begin**, **end**, **step**.

If **begin** value is greater than the **end**, function should returns 0

Examples

```js
sequenceSum(2, 2, 2) === 2;
sequenceSum(2, 6, 2) === 12; // 2 + 4 + 6
sequenceSum(1, 5, 1) === 15; // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
sequenceSum(1, 5, 3) === 5; // 1 + 4
```
