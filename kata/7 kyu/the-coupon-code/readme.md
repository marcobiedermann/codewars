# [The Coupon Code](https://www.codewars.com/kata/539de388a540db7fec000642)

## Story

Your online store likes to give out coupons for special occasions. Some customers try to cheat the system by entering invalid codes or using expired coupons.

## Task

Your mission:
Write a function called `checkCoupon` which verifies that a coupon code is valid and not expired.

A coupon is no more valid on the day **AFTER** the expiration date. All dates will be passed as strings in this format: `"MONTH DATE, YEAR"`.

## Examples:

```js
checkCoupon('123', '123', 'July 9, 2015', 'July 9, 2015') === true;
checkCoupon('123', '123', 'July 9, 2015', 'July 2, 2015') === false;
```
