# [Predict your age!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5aff237c578a14752d0035ae)

My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

- Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
- Multiply each number by itself.
- Add them all together.
- Take the square root of the result.
- Divide by two.

## Example

```javascript
predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86;
```

```R
predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
```

```python
predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
```

```ruby
predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
```

```crystal
predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
```

```c++
predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
```

```php
predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
```

```csharp
predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
```

```lua
Predicter.predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
```

Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Some random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you.
