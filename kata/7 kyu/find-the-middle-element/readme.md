# [Find the middle element](https://www.codewars.com/kata/545a4c5a61aa4c6916000755)

As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.

The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

For example:

    gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0

_2_ is the number that fits between _1_ and _3_ and the index of _2_ in the input array is _0_.

Another example (just to make sure it is clear):

    gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1

_10_ is the number that fits between _5_ and _14_ and the index of _10_ in the input array is _1_.
