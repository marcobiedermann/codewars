# [JavaScript Array Filter](https://www.codewars.com/kata/514a6336889283a3d2000001)

```if:javascript
JavaScript Arrays support a filter function (starting in JavaScript 1.6). Use the filter functionality to complete the function given.
```

```if:csharp
Starting with .NET Framework 3.5, C# supports a `Where` (in the `System.Linq` namespace) method which allows a user to filter arrays based on a predicate. Use the `Where` method to complete the function given.

`Enumerable.Where` documentation:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb534803(v=vs.110).aspx
```

```if:python
In Python, there is a built-in filter function that operates similarly to JS's filter. For more information on how to use this function, visit https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter
```

The solution would work like the following:

```javascript
getEvenNumbers([2, 4, 5, 6]); // should == [2,4,6]
```

```csharp
Kata.GetEvenNumbers(new int[] {2, 4, 5, 6}) => new int[] {2, 4, 6}
```

```crystal
get_even_numbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]
```

```julia
getevennumbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]
```

```coffeescript
getEvenNumbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]
```

```python
get_even_numbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]
```

```ruby
get_even_numbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]
```

```cpp
get_even_numbers({2,4,5,6}) => {2,4,6}
```
