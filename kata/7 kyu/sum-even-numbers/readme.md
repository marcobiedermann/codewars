# [Sum even numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/586beb5ba44cfc44ed0006c3)

Complete the function that takes a sequence of numbers as single parameter. Your function must return the sum of **the even values** of this sequence.

Only numbers without decimals like `4` or `4.0` can be even.

The input is a sequence of numbers: integers and/or floats.

### Examples

```
[4, 3, 1, 2, 5, 10, 6, 7, 9, 8]  -->  30   # because 4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30
[]                               -->  0
```
