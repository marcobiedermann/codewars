# Task

**_Given_** an **_array of integers_** , **_Find the minimum sum_** which is obtained _from summing each Two integers product_ .

---

# Notes

- **_Array/list_** _will contain_ **_positives only_** .
- **_Array/list_** _will always has_ **_even size_**

---

# Input >> Output Examples

```
minSum({5,4,2,3}) ==> return (22)
```

## **_Explanation_**:

- **_The minimum sum_** _obtained from summing each two integers product_ , ` 5*2 + 3*4 = 22`

---

```
minSum({12,6,10,26,3,24}) ==> return (342)
```

## **_Explanation_**:

- **_The minimum sum_** _obtained from summing each two integers product_ , ` 26*3 + 24*6 + 12*10 = 342`

---

```
minSum({9,2,8,7,5,4,0,6}) ==> return (74)
```

## **_Explanation_**:

- **_The minimum sum_** _obtained from summing each two integers product_ , ` 9*0 + 8*2 +7*4 +6*5 = 74`
