# [Convert an array of strings to array of numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5783d8f3202c0e486c001d23)

## Oh no!

Some really funny web dev gave you a _sequence of numbers_ from his API response as an _sequence of strings_!

You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.

Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.

ie:`["1", "2", "3"]` to `[1, 2, 3]`

Note that you can receive floats as well.
