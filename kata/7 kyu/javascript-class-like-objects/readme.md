# [JavaScript class-like objects](https://www.codewars.com/kata/513e1e47c600c93cef000001)

For this exercise you should create a JavaScript class like object called "Animal" that takes in "name" and "type" arguments. It should have a toString method that returns a human readable string indicating the argument information passed in. It should also allow the name property to be set.

The following is an example of how the final code would be used and what the expected return values should be:

```javascript
var dog = new Animal('Max', 'dog');
dog.toString(); // should return 'Max is a dog'
dog.type; // should == 'dog'
dog.name; // should == 'Max'
dog.name = 'Lassie'; // should set name to 'Lassie'
```
