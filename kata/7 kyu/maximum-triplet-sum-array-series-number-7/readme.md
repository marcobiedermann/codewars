# [Maximum Triplet Sum (Array Series #7) ](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5aa1bcda373c2eb596000112)

# Task

**_Given_** an _array/list [] of n integers_ , _find maximum triplet sum in the array_ **_Without duplications_** .

---

# Notes :

- **_Array/list_** size is _at least 3_ .

- **_Array/list_** numbers could be a _mixture of positives , negatives and zeros_ .

- **_Repetition_** of numbers in _the array/list could occur_ , So **_(duplications are not included when summing)_**.

---

# Input >> Output Examples

```cpp
1- maxTriSum ({3,2,6,8,2,3}) ==> return (17)
```

## **_Explanation_**:

- As the **_triplet_** that _maximize the sum_ **_{6,8,3}_** in order , **_their sum is (17)_**

- _Note_ : **_duplications_** _are not included when summing_ , **(i.e) the numbers added only once** .

---

```cpp
2- maxTriSum ({2,1,8,0,6,4,8,6,2,4}) ==> return (18)
```

## **_Explanation_**:

- As the **_triplet_** that _maximize the sum_ **_{8, 6, 4}_** in order , **_their sum is (18)_** ,
- _Note_ : **_duplications_** _are not included when summing_ , **(i.e) the numbers added only once** .

---

```cpp
3- maxTriSum ({-7,12,-7,29,-5,0,-7,0,0,29}) ==> return (41)
```

## **_Explanation_**:

- As the **_triplet_** that _maximize the sum_ **_{12 , 29 , 0}_** in order , **_their sum is (41)_** ,
- _Note_ : **_duplications_** _are not included when summing_ , **(i.e) the numbers added only once** .
