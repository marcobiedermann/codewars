# [Interview Question (easy)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b358a1e228d316283001892)

You receive the name of a city as a string, and you need to return a string that shows how many times each letter shows up in the string by using asterisks (`*`).

For example:

```
"Chicago"  -->  "c:**,h:*,i:*,a:*,g:*,o:*"
```

As you can see, the letter `c` is shown only once, but with 2 asterisks.

The return string should include **only the letters** (not the dashes, spaces, apostrophes, etc). There should be no spaces in the output, and the different letters are separated by a comma (`,`) as seen in the example above.

Note that the return string must list the letters in order of their first appearance in the original string.

More examples:

```
"Bangkok"    -->  "b:*,a:*,n:*,g:*,k:**,o:*"
"Las Vegas"  -->  "l:*,a:**,s:**,v:*,e:*,g:*"
```

Have fun! ;)
