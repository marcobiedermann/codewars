## Task

**_Given_** an _array/list [] of integers_ , **_Find the product of the k maximal_** numbers.

---

### Notes

- **_Array/list_** size is _at least 3_ .

- **_Array/list's numbers_** _Will be_ **_mixture of positives , negatives and zeros_**

- **_Repetition_** of numbers in _the array/list could occur_.

---

### Input >> Output Examples

```
maxProduct ({4, 3, 5}, 2) ==>  return (20)
```

#### _Explanation_:

- **_Since_** _the size (k) equal 2_ , then **_the subsequence of size 2_** _whose gives_ **_product of maxima_** is `5 * 4 = 20` .

---

```
maxProduct ({8, 10 , 9, 7}, 3) ==>  return (720)
```

#### _Explanation_:

- **_Since_** _the size (k) equal 3_ , then **_the subsequence of size 3_** _whose gives_ **_product of maxima_** is ` 8 * 9 * 10 = 720` .

---

```
maxProduct ({10, 8, 3, 2, 1, 4, 10}, 5) ==> return (9600)
```

#### _Explanation_:

- **_Since_** _the size (k) equal 5_ , then **_the subsequence of size 5_** _whose gives_ **_product of maxima_** is ` 10 * 10 * 8 * 4 * 3 = 9600` .

---

```
maxProduct ({-4, -27, -15, -6, -1}, 2) ==> return (4)
```

#### _Explanation_:

- **_Since_** _the size (k) equal 2_ , then **_the subsequence of size 2_** _whose gives_ **_product of maxima_** is ` -4 * -1 = 4` .

---

```
maxProduct ({10, 3, -1, -27} , 3)  return (-30)
```

#### _Explanation_:

- **_Since_** _the size (k) equal 3_ , then **_the subsequence of size 3_** _whose gives_ **_product of maxima_** is `10 * 3 * -1 = -30` .
