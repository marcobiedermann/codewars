# [Sum of Minimums!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5d5ee4c35162d9001af7d699)

```if:csharp,javascript,cfml,php
Given a 2D array of size `m * n`. Your task is to find the sum of minimum value in each row.
```

```if:cpp
Given a 2D vector of size `m * n`. Your task is to find the sum of minimum value in each row.
```

```if:python,ruby
Given a 2D list of size `m * n`. Your task is to find the sum of minimum value in each row.
```

For Example:

```cpp
{
  {1,2,3,4,5},       // minimum value of row is 1
  {5,6,7,8,9},       // minimum value of row is 5
  {20,21,34,56,100}  // minimum value of row is 20
}
```

```csharp
{
  {1,2,3,4,5},       // minimum value of row is 1
  {5,6,7,8,9},       // minimum value of row is 5
  {20,21,34,56,100}  // minimum value of row is 20
}
```

```python
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],       # minimum value of row is 1
  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],       # minimum value of row is 5
  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100]  # minimum value of row is 20
]
```

```ruby
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],       # minimum value of row is 1
  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],       # minimum value of row is 5
  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100]  # minimum value of row is 20
]
```

```javascript
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], // minimum value of row is 1
  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], // minimum value of row is 5
  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100], // minimum value of row is 20
];
```

```cfml
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],       // minimum value of row is 1
  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],       // minimum value of row is 5
  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100]  // minimum value of row is 20
]
```

```php
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],       # minimum value of row is 1
  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],       # minimum value of row is 5
  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100]  # minimum value of row is 20
]
```

So, the function should return `26` because sum of minimums is as `1 + 5 + 20 = 26`

```if:javascript,php
Note: You will be always given non-empty array containing Positive values.
```

```if:python
Note: You will be always given non-empty list containing Positive values.
```

```if:cpp
Note: You will be always given non-empty vector containing Positive values.
```

```if:c#
Note: You will be always given non-empty vector containing Positive values.
```

```if:cfml
Note: You will be always given non-empty array containing Positive values.
```

ENJOY CODING :)
