# [N-th Fibonacci](https://www.codewars.com/kata/522551eee9abb932420004a0)

I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.

I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n) returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

For example:

```javascript
nthFibo(4) == 2;
```

```coffeescript
   nthFibo(4) == 2
```

```ruby
   nth_fibonacci(4) == 2
```

```haskell
   fib 4 == 2
```

```lambdacalc
   nth-fibo 4 == 2
```

```python
   nth_fib(4) == 2
```

```csharp
   NthFib(4) == 2
```

```c
   nth_fib(4) == 2
```

```julia
   nthfibo(4) == 2
```

```nasm
    mov edi, 4
    call nth_fib
    cmp rax, 2 ; should be equal
```

Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
