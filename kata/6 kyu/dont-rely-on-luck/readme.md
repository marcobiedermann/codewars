# [Don't rely on luck.](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5268af3872b786f006000228)

The test fixture I use for this kata is pre-populated.

It will compare your guess to a random number generated using:

```ruby
(Kernel::rand() * 100 + 1).floor
```

```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1);
```

```python
randint(1,100)
```

```php
rand(1, 100)
```

You can pass by relying on luck or skill but try not to rely on luck.

Good luck!
