# [Playing with digits](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5552101f47fc5178b1000050)

Some numbers have funny properties. For example:

> 89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 \* 1

> 695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 \* 2

> 46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 \* 51

Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p

- we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k \* n.

In other words:

> Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n \* k

If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.

**Note**: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.
