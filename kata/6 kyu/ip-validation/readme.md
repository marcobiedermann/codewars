# [IP Validation](https://www.codewars.com/kata/515decfd9dcfc23bb6000006)

Write an algorithm that will identify valid IPv4 addresses in dot-decimal format. IPs should be considered valid if they consist of four octets, with values between `0` and `255`, inclusive.

Input to the function is guaranteed to be a single string.

### Examples

Valid inputs:

```
1.2.3.4
123.45.67.89
```

Invalid inputs:

```
1.2.3
1.2.3.4.5
123.456.78.90
123.045.067.089
```

Note that leading zeros (e.g. `01.02.03.04`) are considered invalid.
