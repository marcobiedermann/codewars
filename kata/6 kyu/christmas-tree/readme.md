# [Christmas tree](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52755006cc238fcae70000ed)

Create a function that returns a christmas tree of the correct height.

For example:

`height = 5` should return:

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

Height passed is always an integer between 0 and 100.

Use `\n` for newlines between each line.

Pad with spaces so each line is the same length. The last line having only stars, no spaces.
