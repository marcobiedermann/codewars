# [Function Composition](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5421c6a2dda52688f6000af8)

**Function composition** is a mathematical operation that mainly presents itself in lambda calculus and computability. It is explained well [here](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/functions-composition.html), but this is my explanation, in simple mathematical notation:

```
f3 = compose( f1 f2 )
   Is equivalent to...
f3(a) = f1( f2( a ) )
```

```if-not:lambdacalc,ruby
Your task is to create a `compose` function to carry out this task, which will be passed two functions or lambdas. Ruby functions will be passed, and should return, either a proc or a lambda. Remember that the resulting composed function may be passed multiple arguments!
```

```if:ruby
Your task is to create a `compose` function to carry out this task, which will be passed two functions, and should return either a proc or a lambda. Remember that the resulting composed function may be passed multiple arguments!
```

```if:lambdacalc
Your task is to create a `compose` function to carry out this task.
```

```javascript
compose(f , g)(x)
=> f( g( x ) )
```

```ruby
compose(f , g).(x)
=> f.( g.( x ) )
```

```coffeescript
compose(f , g)(x)
=> f( g( x ) )
```

```clojure
((compose f  g) x)
=> (f (g x) )
```

```python
compose(f , g)(x)
=> f( g( x ) )
```

```lambdacalc
h = compose f g
h x # f (g x)
```

This kata is not available in haskell; that would be too easy!
