# [Persistent Bugger.](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55bf01e5a717a0d57e0000ec)

Write a function, `persistence`, that takes in a positive parameter `num` and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in `num` until you reach a single digit.

For example:

```c
persistence(39) === 3;
//     because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4
//         and 4 has only one digit

persistence(999) === 4;
//     because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12,
// and finally 1*2 = 2

persistence(4) === 0;
//     because 4 is already a one-digit number
```

```swift
 persistence(for: 39) === 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                       // and 4 has only one digit

 persistence(for: 999) === 4 // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                        // 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

 persistence(for: 4) === 0 // because 4 is already a one-digit number
```

```javascript
persistence(39) === 3; // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
// and 4 has only one digit

persistence(999) === 4; // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
// 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

persistence(4) === 0; // because 4 is already a one-digit number
```

```php
persistence(39) === 3; // because 3 * 9 = 27, 2 * 7 = 14, 1 * 4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit
persistence(999) === 4; // because 9 * 9 * 9 = 729, 7 * 2 * 9 = 126, 1 * 2 * 6 = 12, and finally 1 * 2 = 2
persistence(4) === 0; // because 4 is already a one-digit number
```

```coffeescript
 persistence(39) === 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                       // and 4 has only one digit

 persistence(999) === 4 // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                        // 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

 persistence(4) === 0 // because 4 is already a one-digit number
```

```csharp
 persistence(39) == 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                      // and 4 has only one digit

 persistence(999) == 4 // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                       // 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

 persistence(4) == 0 // because 4 is already a one-digit number
```

```fsharp
persistence 39 = 3  // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                    // and 4 has only one digit

persistence 999 = 4 // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                    // 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

persistence 4 = 0   // because 4 is already a one-digit number
```

```java
 persistence(39) == 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                      // and 4 has only one digit

 persistence(999) == 4 // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                       // 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

 persistence(4) == 0 // because 4 is already a one-digit number
```
