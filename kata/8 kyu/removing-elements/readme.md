# [Removing Elements](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5769b3802ae6f8e4890009d2)

Take an array and remove every second element out of that array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

Example:

```python
my_list = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]
```

```ruby
my_arr = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]
```

```javascript
myArr = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...];
```

```scala
myArr = List("Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...)
```

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
