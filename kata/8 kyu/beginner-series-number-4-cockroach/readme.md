# [Beginner Series #4 Cockroach](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55fab1ffda3e2e44f00000c6)

The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

```python
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
```

```csharp
CockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```

```javascript
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30;
```

```coffeescript
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```

```haskell
cockroachSpeed 1.08 == 30
```

```java
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```

```ruby
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
```

```prolog
cockroach_speed(1.08, 30).
```

```cfml
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```

```c
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
```

```cpp
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
```

Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
