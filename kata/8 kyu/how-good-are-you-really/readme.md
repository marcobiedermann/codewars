# [How good are you really?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5601409514fc93442500010b)

There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!</br>
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.</br>

You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!</br>

```if-not:nasm,racket
Return `True` if you're better, else `False`!
```

```if:racket
Return #t if you're better, else #f.
```

```if:nasm
Return `1` if you're better, else `0`!
```

### Note:

Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!
