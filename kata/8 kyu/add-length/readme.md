# [Add Length](https://www.codewars.com/kata/559d2284b5bb6799e9000047)

What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

```javascript
addLength('apple ban') => ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
addLength('you will win') => ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
```

```python
add_length('apple ban') => ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
add_length('you will win') => ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
```

```ruby
add_length('apple ban') => ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
add_length('you will win') => ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
```

```coffeescript
addLength 'apple ban' => ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
addLength 'you will win' => ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
```

```elixir
add_length("apple ban") => ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
add_length("you will win") => ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
```

```csharp
Kata.AddLength("apple ban")    => new string[] {"apple 5", "ban 3"};
Kata.AddLength("you will win") => new string[] {"you 3", "will 4", "win 3"};
```

Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

**Note:** String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.
