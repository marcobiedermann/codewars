# [Reversing Words in a String](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a55c8b72292d057b000594)

You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:

As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

```javascript
reverse('Hello World') === 'World Hello';
reverse('Hi There.') === 'There. Hi';
```

```python
reverse('Hello World') == 'World Hello'
reverse('Hi There.') == 'There. Hi'
```

```csharp
Kata.Reverse("Hello World"); // -> "World Hello"
Kata.Reverse("Hi There."); // -> "There. Hi"
```

```php
reverse("Hello World") === "World Hello"
reverse("Hi There.") === "There. Hi"
```

```objc
reverse(@"Hello World"); // -> "World Hello"
reverse(@"Hi There."); // -> "There. Hi"
```

Happy coding!
