# [Finish Guess the Number Game](https://www.codewars.com/kata/568018a64f35f0c613000054)

Imagine you are creating a game where the user has to guess the correct number. But there is a limit of how many guesses the user can do.

- If the user tries to guess more than the limit, the function should throw an error.
- If the user guess is right it should return true.
- If the user guess is wrong it should return false and lose a life.

Can you finish the game so all the rules are met?
