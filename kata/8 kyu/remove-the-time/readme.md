# [Remove the time](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56b0ff16d4aa33e5bb00008e)

You're re-designing a blog and the blog's posts have the following format for showing the date and time a post was made:

_Weekday_ _Month_ _Day_, _time_
e.g.,
Friday May 2, 7pm

You're running out of screen real estate, and on some pages you want to display a shorter format, _Weekday_ _Month_ _Day_ that omits the time.

Write a function, shortenToDate, that takes the Website date/time in its original string format, and returns the shortened format.

Assume shortenToDate's input will always be a string, e.g. "Friday May 2, 7pm". Assume shortenToDate's output will be the shortened string, e.g., "Friday May 2".
