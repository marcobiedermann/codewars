# [Find numbers which are divisible by given number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55edaba99da3a9c84000003b)

Complete the function which takes two arguments and returns all numbers which are divisible by the given divisor. First argument is an array of `numbers` and the second is the `divisor`.

## Example

```javascript
divisibleBy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6];
```

```coffeescript
divisibleBy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```

```python
divisible_by([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```

```php
divisible_by([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```

```ruby
divisible_by([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```

```elixir
divisible_by([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```

```cpp
divisible_by({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 2) == {2, 4, 6}
```

```csharp
DivisibleBy(new int[]{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 2) == new int[] {2, 4, 6}
```

```haskell
divisibleBy :: [Int] -> Int -> [Int]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] `divisibleBy` 2 = [2, 4, 6]
```

```racket
(divisible-by '(1 2 3 4 5 6) 2) ; '(2 4 6)
```

```prolog
divisible_by([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) = [2, 4, 6]
```
