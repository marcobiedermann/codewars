# [Merge two sorted arrays into one](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5899642f6e1b25935d000161)

You are given two sorted arrays that contain only integers. Your task is to find a way to merge them into a single one, sorted in **ascending order**. Complete the function `mergeArrays(arr1, arr2)`, where `arr1` and `arr2` are the original sorted arrays.

You don't need to worry about validation, since `arr1` and `arr2` must be arrays with 0 or more Integers. If both `arr1` and `arr2` are empty, then just return an empty array.

**Note:** `arr1` and `arr2` may be sorted in different orders. Also `arr1` and `arr2` may have same integers. Remove duplicated in the returned result.

## Examples

```javascript
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
mergeArrays(arr1, arr2); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

arr3 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];
arr4 = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2];
mergeArrays(arr3, arr4); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

arr5 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12];
arr6 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12];
mergeArrays(arr5, arr6); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12]
```

Happy coding!
