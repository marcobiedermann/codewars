# [Filling an array (part 1)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/571d42206414b103dc0006a1)

We want an array, but not just any old array, an array with contents!

Write a function that produces an array with the numbers `0` to `N-1` in it.

For example, the following code will result in an array containing the numbers `0` to `4`:

```
arr(5) // => [0,1,2,3,4]
```
